## ‚úÖ Successfully Created

- **MSIX Package**: `bin/RScreenRecord.msix` (151 KB)
- **Store Assets**: All required visual assets generated from icon
- **Manifest**: Properly configured for Microsoft Store
- **Documentation**: Complete Store submission README

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Full Trust Extension

The MSIX package was created without the `windows.fullTrustProcess` extension due to MakeAppx tool limitations. For Microsoft Store submission, you may need to:

1. **Use Visual Studio**: Open the `.wapproj` file in Visual Studio and build through IDE
2. **Update SDK**: Ensure latest Windows SDK is installed
3. **Alternative Tools**: Use newer packaging tools if available

### To Add Full Trust Support:

The manifest should include this extension inside the `<Application>` element:

```xml
<Extensions>
  <rescap:Extension Category="windows.fullTrustProcess" />
</Extensions>
```

This is required for desktop applications that need full system access.
